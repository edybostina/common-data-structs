# Data Structures Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C, including linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, and more. Each data structure is implemented with a focus on modularity, reusability, and clarity.

## Overview

This project provides a collection of fundamental data structures implemented in C. Each data structure is accompanied by a set of utility functions to perform common operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and more.

## Implemented Data Structures

### 1. Linked List

- Singly linked list implementation.
- Supports operations like insertion, deletion, reversal, sorting, and searching.

### 2. Stack

- LIFO (Last In, First Out) stack implementation.
- Supports operations like push, pop, peek, and stack reversal.

### 3. Queue

- FIFO (First In, First Out) queue implementation.
- Supports operations like enqueue, dequeue, and queue reversal.

### 4. Binary Tree

- Binary tree implementation with support for:
  - In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.
  - Searching, insertion, and deletion.
  - Height, size, and balance checks.

### 5. Hash Table

- **(Implementation Pending)**

### 6. Heap

- **(Implementation Pending)**

## How to Build and Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edybostina/common-data-structs.git
   cd data-structures
   ```

````
2. Compile the code:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    ./tests/run_tests
    ```
````

## Testing

The `test_data_structures.c` file contains test cases for each implemented data structure. You can interactively test the data structures by running the compiled program and selecting the desired option from the menu.
